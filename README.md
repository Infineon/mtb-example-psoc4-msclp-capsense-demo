# PSoC&trade; 4: MSCLP robust low-power liquid-tolerant CAPSENSE&trade;

This code example implements a low-power, liquid-tolerant, and robust capacitive sensing solution with the [PSoC&trade; 4000T](www.infineon.com/002-33949) device using the [CY8CKIT-040T CAPSENSE&trade; evaluation kit](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-040T).

This code example demonstrates advanced features of multi-sense convertor low-power (MSCLP), the 5th-generation low-power CAPSENSE&trade; block in [PSoC&trade; 4000T](www.infineon.com/002-33949). This kit has onboard capacitive sensors (a self-cap touch button, proximity sensor, and a touchpad) that operate in ultra-low-power mode and only respond to a valid finger touch. The sensors are deactivated when there is any liquid present on the sensors. The kit has onboard LEDs to indicate different touch operations.

Use only the [CY8CKIT-040T](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-040T) kit for testing this code example.

The project has the necessary settings by default, so you can go to the [Operation](#operation) section to test the example. If you want to understand the tuning process and follow the stages for this kit or your own board, go to [Tuning procedure](#tuning-procedure) and then test it using the [Operation](#operation) section.

## Operation

1. Connect the USB cable between the [CY8CKIT-040T kit](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-040T) and the PC as follows:

    **Figure 1. Connecting the CY8CKIT-040T kit with the PC**

    <img src="images/psoc_4000t_kit_connected.png" alt="Figure 1" width="250"/>

2. SWD, I2C, and User LED modes are multiplexed to the same pins (GPIO pins P3[2] and P3[3]) in CY8CKIT-040T. The interface can be switched between these using the FW-loader commands. Download and unzip the *Batch_files_for_mux_selection* zip file from the Beta package to the *bin* folder inside the *fw-loader* folder in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation directory.

   Default location: */ModusToolbox/tools_3.0/fw-loader/bin*

   Select SWD mode by running the `Select_SWD` batch file to program the CY8CKIT-040T kit. For detailed information, see **Section 2.3.1** in [CY8CKIT-040T kit user guide](www.infineon.com/002-34870).

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
      </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-040T TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

   After programming, the application starts automatically.

4. Touch any of the sensors with your finger. LEDs turn ON indicating the activation of different CAPSENSE&trade; sensors in the following pattern:

   - LED1 turns ON in blue when the button is touched.
   - LED1 and LED3 turn ON in green when the touchpad is touched.
      - LED1 brightness increases when finger is swiped from left to right.
      - LED3 brightness increases when finger is swiped from bottom to up.

5. Use a water dropper (shipped with the kit package) to place water droplets on top of the sensors. Observe that all LEDs are in OFF state indicating that no false trigger occurs due to the presence of water. See [kit user guide](www.infineon.com/002-34870) to know more on the test procedure.

6. Spray water over the sensors. Observe that false touches are not reported and LEDs do not turn ON. See the [kit user guide](www.infineon.com/002-34870) to know more on the test procedure.

   **Figure 2. Spraying water on top of the sensors**

   <img src="images/psoc_4000t_sensors_water_spray.png" alt="Figure 2" width="450"/>

7. Splash water on top of the sensors. Observe that false touches are not reported.

8. Dip the kit inside water (up to the immersible line) for some time and remove it. Repeat it multiple times. Observe that all LEDs are in OFF state continuously, indicating that no false trigger occurs due to immersion in water.

   **Figure 3. Immersing the kit inside water (up to immersible line)**

   <img src="images/psoc_4000t_sensors_water_dip.png" alt="Figure 3" width="450"/>

9. Perform experiments mentioned in step 5, 6, 7 and 8 using salty water. Observe that all LEDs are in OFF state continuously, indicating that no false trigger occurs due to immersion. It is recommended that testing the liquid-tolerance performance of the sensors with the salty water by dissolving 40 grams of cooking salt (NaCl) in one liter of water.


### Monitor the data using the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner

1. Select the I2C mode by running the `Select_I2C` batch file to enable the I2C communication between onboard KitProg and CAPSENSE&trade; tuner.

2. Open CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner from the **Tools** section in the IDE Quick Panel.

   You can also run the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner application standalone from the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/capsense-configurator/capsense-tuner*. In this case, after opening the application, select **File** > **Open** and open the *design.cycapsense* file of the respective application, which is present in the *{Application root directory}/bsps/TARGET_APP_\<BSP-NAME>/COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS/* folder.

	SeeÂ theÂ [ModusToolbox&trade;Â userÂ guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide)Â (locallyÂ availableÂ atÂ *{ModusToolbox&trade;Â installÂ directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*)Â forÂ optionsÂ toÂ openÂ theÂ CAPSENSE&trade;Â TunerÂ applicationÂ usingÂ theÂ CLI.

3. Ensure the kit is in CMSIS-DAP bulk mode (KitProg3 Status LED is ON and not blinking). See [Firmware-loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) to learn how to update the firmware and switch modes in KitProg3.

4. In the tuner application, select **Tools** > **Tuner Communication Setup**. In the window that appears, select the I2C checkbox under KitProg3 and configure as follows:

   - I2C address: 8
   - Sub-address: 2-Bytes
   - Speed (kHz): 400

   These are the same values set in the EZI2C resource.

   **Figure 4. Tuner communication setup**

   <img src="images/tuner_setup.png" alt="Figure 4" width="500" />

5. Click **Connect** or select **Communication** > **Connect** to establish a connection.

6. Click **Start** or select **Communication** > **Start** to start data streaming from the device.

   The tuner displays the data from the sensor in the **Widget View**, **Graph View**, and **Touchpad View** tabs.

7. Set **Read Mode** to 'Synchronized'. Under the **Widget View** tab, you can see the different sensor widgets highlighted in blue when you touch it.

   **Figure 5. Widget view of CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner**

   <img src="images/widget-view.png" alt="Figure 5" width="900"/>

8. You can view the raw count, baseline, difference count, and status for each sensor, and the touchpad position in the **Graph View** tab. To view the sensor data for a button, select **BUTTON_Sns0** under **BUTTON** (see Figure 6). To view the touchpad sensor data, select **TOUCHPAD_Col0** under **TOUCHPAD** (see Figure 7).

   **Figure 6. Graph view of button signals in CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner**

   <img src="images/graph_view_button_response.png" alt="Figure 6" width="900"/>

   **Figure 7. Graph view of touchpad signals in CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner**

   <img src="images/graph_view_touchpad_response.png" alt="Figure 7" width="900"/>

9. Go to the **Touchpad View** tab to view the heatmap, which visualizes the finger movement.

   **Figure 8. Touchpad view of CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner**

   <img src="images/touchpad-view.png" alt="Figure 8" width="900"/>

10. Go to the **Widget/Sensor Parameters** section in the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner window. The compensation CDAC values for each touchpad sensor element calculated by the CAPSENSE&trade; resource is displayed as shown in Figure 8.

### Measure current at different application states

1. Disable the serial LED and EZI2C to measure the device current in each state.

   Set the macros `SWD_DEBUG_ENABLE` and `ENABLE_SERIAL_LED` in *main.c* as follows:

    ```
      #define SWD_DEBUG_ENABLE                 (1u)

      #define ENABLE_SERIAL_LED                (0u)
    ```

2. After programming, run the `Select_No_Connection` batch file to completely disconnect the MCU from the onboard KitProg.

3. Connect an ammeter to the **Current measurement** header to measure the current consumption for different application states (see Figure 10). To know more on the setup, see the [kit user guide](www.infineon.com/002-34870).

   **Figure 9. Current measurement setup**

   <img src="images/psoc_4000t_kit_ammeter_setup.png" alt="Figure 9" width="350"/>

4. When there is any touch on one of the sensors, the device is in Active state. Measure the device current during the active state of operation. If the refresh rate is set to 128 Hz, the approximate device current would be 525uA when the touchpad is touched (see Figure 10).

   **Figure 10. Power consumption profile of PSoC&trade; 4000T**

   <img src="images/psoc_4000t_current_results.png" alt="Figure 10" width="700"/>

5. When there is no touch on any of the sensors for some time, the CAPSENSE&trade; block moves to a state called "Active low refresh rate". If the refresh rate of this state is set to 32 Hz, the approximate device current would be 130 uA.

6. Further inactivity on any of the sensors moves the CAPSENSE&trade; block to the lowest power state. The device current in this state is approximately 7 uA if the refresh rate is set to 16 Hz. The following table shows the current values measured for VDD=1.8 V:


**Table 1. Device current at different application states**

|  Application State | Refresh Rate(Hz)| Current (in uA) of the default code example | Current (in uA) with serial LED and EZI2C disabled |
| :--------| :---------------|:---------------------| :------------------- |
| Wake on Touch | 16 | 7  | 7 |
| Active low refresh rate | 32 | 140 | 130 |
| Active | 128 | 690 |  525 |


7. The ILO clock is used to control the refresh rate in this project. This clock is expected to have up to 50% variation across different PSoC&trade; 4000T devices. Measure the actual ILO clock frequency and update the `MEASURED_ILO_IN_KHz` macro in *main.c*. For details see the document ***PSoCâ¢ 4000T device current measurement â
KBA235704***.

    ```
      #define MEASURED_ILO_IN_KHz              (40u)
    ```

## Tuning procedure

### Create a custom BSP for your board

1. Create a custom BSP for your board having any device by following the steps given in [KBA231373](https://community.cypress.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/ModusToolbox-2-2-and-later-Make-a-Custom-BSP-KBA231373/ta-p/251107). In this code example, it was created for the device "CY8C4046LQI-T452â.

2. Open the *design.modus* file from *{Application root directory}/bsps/TARGET_APP_\<BSP-NAME>/COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS/* folder obtained in the previous step and enable CAPSENSE&trade; to get the *design.cycapsense* file. The CAPSENSE&trade; configuration can then be started from scratch as follows:

### Tuning parameters

This code example has the optimum tuning parameters of all the sensors. See the following code examples that describe the tuning procedure of different sensors:

1. [CE235178](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-msclp-self-capacitance-button) for self-cap button tuning procedure

2. [CE235338](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-msclp-self-capacitance-touchpad) for self-cap touchpad tuning procedure

3. [CE235111](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-msclp-capsense-low-power) for tuning the low-power widget of the [PSoC&trade; 4000T](www.infineon.com/002-33949) device

The inactive sensors and the hatch pattern in both the planes of the PCB is by default assigned to the active shield. This increases the sensitivity of the sensors and is required for implementing liquid tolerance for sensors.

**Figure 11. Enabling shield signals in CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator**

<img src="images/psoc_4000t_shield_settings.png" alt="Figure 11" width="700"/>

**Note:** See the "Selecting CAPSENSE&trade; hardware parameters" section in the [AN85951 â PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.cypress.com/an85951) to learn about the considerations for selecting parameter values.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** The debug port is disabled by default for CY8CKIT-040T, because it uses the pins P3[2] (SWDIO) and P3[3] (SWDCK) for I2C SDA and SCL. If debug is required, do the following:

1. Change the **Debug Mode** setting under the **Systems** tab in the Device Configurator to **SWD**.

2. Disable I2C in the project:

   1. Disable the **Serial Communication Block (SCB)** resource with **EZI2C** personality in **Peripherals Tab** in the Device Configurator.

   2. Enable the **SWD_DEBUG_ENABLE** macro present in the *main.c* file as follows:

       ```
         #define SWD_DEBUG_ENABLE (1u)
       ```
   See **Step 4** of **Section 2.3** of the [kit user guide](www.infineon.com/002-34870) for more details.


## Design and implementation

The project uses the [CAPSENSE&trade; middleware](https://infineon.github.io/capsense/capsense_api_reference_manual/html/index.html); see the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](http://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details on selecting a middleware.

See [AN85951 â PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.cypress.com/an85951) for more details of CAPSENSE&trade; features and usage.

The design has a ratiometric implementation of the following sensors, as shown in Figure 13.

1. One touchpad widget with 9 elements (4 rows and 5 columns)
2. One self-capacitance button widget (1 element)
3. One Wake-On-Touch widget (1 element), also called "low-power widget"
4. Proximity sensor of the board configured as a self-capacitance guard sensor (1 element)
5. Multiple combinations of proximity and touchpad sensors configured as mutual-cap guard sensors (7 elements)

**Figure 12. Widgets in CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator**

<img src="images/cy8ckit-040t-sensor-widgets.png" alt="Figure 12" width="700"/>

The design also has an EZI2C peripheral and a SPI master peripheral.

The EZI2C slave peripheral is used to monitor the information of sensor raw and processed data on a PC using the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner available in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; via I2C communication.

The MOSI pin of the SPI slave peripheral is used to transfer data to the three serially connected LEDs for controlling color, brightness, and ON/OFF operation.

The firmware is designed to support the following CAPSENSE&trade; states by using PSoC&trade; 4000T device:

- Active state
- Active low-refresh rate state
- Wake-on-touch state
- Liquid active state

**Figure 13. State machine showing different CAPSENSE&trade; states**

<img src="images/psoc_4000t_simple_state_machine.png" alt="Figure 13" width="400"/>

The firmware state machine and the operation of the device in four different states are explained in the following steps:

1. Initializes and starts all hardware components after reset.

2. The device starts CAPSENSE&trade; operation in the Active state. The following steps will occur in this state:

   1. The device scans all CAPSENSE&trade; sensors present on the board.

   2. During the ongoing scan operation, the CPU moves to the deep sleep state.

   3. The interrupt generated on scan completion wakes the CPU, which processes the sensor data and transfers the data to CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner through EZI2C.

   4. Turns on the serial LED with specific colors and patterns to indicate the specific touch operation.

   In Active state, a scan of the selected sensors happen with the highest refresh rate of 128 Hz.

3. Enters the state of Active low-refresh rate when there is no touch detected for a timeout period. In this state, a scan of selected sensors happens with a lower refresh rate of 32 Hz. Power consumption in the Active low-refresh rate state is lower compared to the Active state. The state machine returns to the Active state if there is any touch detected on any sensor.

4. Enters the Wake-on-touch state when there is no touch detected in the Active low-refresh rate state for a timeout period. In this state, the CPU completely moves to deep sleep, and doesn't get involved in CAPSENSE&trade; operation. This is the lowest power state of the device. In the Wake-on-touch state, the CAPSENSE&trade; hardware executes the scanning of the selected sensors called "low-power widgets" and processes the scan data for these widgets. If any touch detected, the CAPSENSE&trade; block wakes up the CPU and the device moves to the Active state.

5. Enters the 'Liquid Active' state when one of the guard sensors is activated. The guard sensors are used to detect the presence of liquid on the board. When the [CY8CKIT-040T](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-040T) kit is dipped inside liquid, or liquid is sprayed on the sensors, the response of one of the guard sensors becomes different from normal finger touch. Then the device moves into the "Liquid Active" state. In this state, no other sensors other than the guard sensor is scanned. This state restricts normal scan operation and avoids any false touch by deactivating the scan operation of active sensors. When the liquid is removed from the senor, CAPSENSE&trade; moves to the Active state.

There are three onboard LEDs connected to the SPI MOSI pin of the device. The three LEDs form a daisy-chain connection and the communication happens over the serial interface to create an RGB configuration. The LED accepts a 32-bit input code, with three bytes for red, green, and blue color.

### Set up the VDDA supply voltage in Device Configurator

1. Open Device Configurator from the Quick Panel.

2. Go to the **System** tab. Select the **Power** resource, and set the VDDA value under **Operating Conditions** as follows:

   **Figure 14. Setting the VDDA supply in the System tab of Device Configurator**

   <img src="images/vdda-settings.png" alt="Figure 14" width="700"/>

**Note:** [PSoC&trade; 4000T CAPSENSE&trade; evaluation kit](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-040T) has one onboard regulator that generates 1.8 V. Check the VDDA voltage and VDDD voltage in Device Configurator - Systems tab to 1800 mV. See the [kit user guide](www.infineon.com/002-34870) for more details.
